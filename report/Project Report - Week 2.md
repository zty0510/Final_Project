## Control the LED

- Describe how you connect the LED to your Pi. You could answer this question with a diagram of your system;
- What functions or classes did you use to control the LED? How did you determine which LED to control in you code when multiple LEDs were presented in the system?

## Integration with the Crawler

- What did you implement in [`state.py`](http://state.py) so that the behavior of the class could be observed when running `state.py` directly while importing anything from the file would not cause the demo to be run?
