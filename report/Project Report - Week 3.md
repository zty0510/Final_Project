Please submit this report as a PDF file along with your code to receive full score of the project. 

## Workload Division

- Fill in the names and email addresses of your group members and describe how you divide works among team members;

## Preliminary Comment

- Please cite any online or offline resources you consulted in this project;
- Please describe the difficulties you encountered in this project;

## Easy: Use CLI

- How do you get the user input in Python when building your CLI program?
- Briefly describe how you design the scheme of the command? Give example command for doing the following things:
    - Change the central coordinate to 30N 101W;
    - Change the range to 100 nm;
    - Change the frequency of data crawling to once per 5 sec.

## Advanced: Use Flask and HTML

Answering the following questions with a concrete example is desirable.

- How to serve the request sent from the client for a specific path? For example, if a request is requesting the path `\public` on your server and another one is requesting `\confidential` on your server, how could you distinguish them and send different responses?
- How to serve the different request methods? For example, one request is sent to your server for the path `\public` with a `GET` method and another one with a `POST` method, how could you distinguish them and send different responses?
- How to render a HTML template in Flask? How to create a simple template in Flask?
- How to get the form data a user sends to your server in a `POST` request? Which data type is it?
- How to specify the title of a web page? How to add a paragraph to a web page? How to add a title to a web page?
- How to design a form on a web page? How to add text box to your form? How to add an option to your form?
- How to send the content of the form to the server? What HTTP methods are generally used for those requests? In Flask, how do you handle the request containing a form?

## Implementation

- How do you share the flight data between the crawler and the web server? Which approach do you choose?
- Which parameters in your program is allowed to be changed?
